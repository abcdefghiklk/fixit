Changes from NiCad 3.5 in 3.6

1. Updated and corrected Python grammar to handle some newer Python 3 features.

2. Fixed bugs in build and code of tools/clonepairs and tools/crossclones
        that were causing "Clone detection failed" crashes.

3. Updated and enhanced "fixspaces" script to fix $, ( ), { }, [ ], and other
        special characters in file and folder names.

4. Fixed type error in tools/main.c that caused â€œmake" to fail on some platforms.

5. Fixed bug in NiCad scripts that prevented thresholds with two or more digits
        (e.g., 0.25)

6. Fixed bug in Extract script that failed when directories were named as source
        files (e.g., xxx/yyy.java/zzz.java)

7. Fixed bug in NICadPair and NiCadCross scripts that created strange result
        file names when system was given with a trailing  slash 
        (e.g., examples/JHotDraw/ )

8. Added support for two-digit thresholds (e.g., threshold=0.25)

9. Retired Mandriva version of NiCad scripts.

10. Changed tool build Makefile to use platform default machine size.
