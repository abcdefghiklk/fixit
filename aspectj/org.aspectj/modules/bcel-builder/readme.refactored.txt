There are problems with the 'refactoring' branch of the bcel-builder project.
For some reason if I commit things into the branch, they go into HEAD - whether
there was a problem creating the branch, I'm not sure.  So as a temporary measure
I am committing the refactored form of the bcel-builder module in as a jar called
bcel-builder.refactored.jar.
