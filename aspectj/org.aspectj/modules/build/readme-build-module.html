<h1>AspectJ build</h1>

This build module contains taskdefs and resources for doing builds
and checking source licenses.  This document describes our approach
to builds and provides some notes for maintaining the build module
and debugging builds.
For information
on running builds and doing testing for the AspectJ project, see
  <a href="readme-build-and-test-aspectj.html">
           readme-build-and-test-aspectj.html</a>.

<h3>Approach</h3>
The AspectJ project source files are broken into modules, 
the subdirectories of the modules directory.
(To eclipse users, each module is a Java or AspectJ project.)
The modules are compiled independently and may be assembled
by the build script into the release jar files.
All required libraries are checked into the <code>lib</code> module.
We use Ant to drive the build, but the logic for building and
assembling modules resides in the BuildModule taskdef,
which reads module dependencies from the Eclipse .classpath files
and assembles the product according to the templates in the
product directory.
This makes it easy to change dependencies and add modules,
but could make it difficult to debug if something were to go wrong.


<h3>Maintaining the build module</h3>
 
Because the BuildModule taskdef extracts dependencies from the Eclipse 
<code>.classpath</code> file, there is no need to update build scripts when
adding or removing modules or changing their dependencies, so long
as they are all in the base modules directory (usually the base of
the eclipse workspace).
Likewise, updating a product assembly should be easy, 
since they are based on introspection of the product directories.

Still, the taskdef workings are not obvious in the build script, so 
this section makes clear some of the implicit logic
in case it's required when debugging build failures or
to make changes.

<h4>Build module code updates</h4>
The build module produces taskdefs used to run the build.
The scripts avoid bootstrapping by using a build library jar 
checked in to
  <code>lib/build/build.jar</code>.
That means code updates in the build module are not reflected in
the build process until the <code>build.jar</code> produced by 
building this <code>build</code> module replaces that found in
  <code>lib/build/build.jar</code>.  Once the module update is
  confirmed, the new <code>lib/build/build.jar</code> must be checked in
  to propogate the changes to other users.
The scripts support an Ant variable <code>check.build.jar</code> 
by warning when <code>lib/build/build.jar</code> is out of date.

<h4>BuildModule task</h4>
The 
<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/ant/taskdefs/BuildModule.java">
   BuildModule</a>
taskdef implements an integrated module or product build.
<p/><u>Module builds</u> are based on the Eclipse <code>.classpath</code>
file, and can produce
a jar with the module classes, with two variations: 
<ul>
  <li> include only the module classes, 
      or assemble the jar complete with all antecedent modules and 
      libraries;
  </li><li>compile the module(s) with or without any
           testing source or libraries
  </li>
</ul>
If there is a file {moduleName}.mf.txt
in the module directory, it will be used as the manifest for the
module jar file.

<p/><u>Product builds</u> are defined by introspection of a 
<a href="products">products</a> subdirectory like 
<a href="products/tools">products/tools</a> for the AspectJ installer.

These have an <code>install</code> directory for installer resources
and a <code>dist</code> directory containing all files belonging in
the distribution, including 0-length placeholders for the module build
results (e.g., <a href="products/tools/dist/lib">products/tools/dist/lib</a>).
These placeholder file names are mapped to the originating
module by <code>Builder.moduleAliasFor(String)</code>
using values in 
	<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties">
       Builder.properties</a>.
(The "-all" suffix in the source jars means that the module and all required
modules are included.)
<p/>
<a name="version"></a>
<h4>Version synchronization</h4>
The version is expressed in the jar manifests, in the <code>Version</code> class, 
and in some documentation files.  The build script 
ensures all version expressions
are aligned.  When not doing or testing release builds, 
developers use the default "DEVELOPMENT" version.

<p/>The build version is set in 
<a href="build-properties.xml">build-properties.xml</a> and propogated
using Ant copy filters out to
the <a href="../aspectj5rt/aspectj5rt.mf.txt">aspectjrt.jar manifest</a>,
the <a href="../ajbrowser/ajbrowser.mf.txt">aspectjtools.jar manifest</a>
and to 
<a href="../bridge/src/org/aspectj/bridge/Version.java">
         ../bridge/src/org/aspectj/bridge/Version.java</a>
which the <a href="build.xml">build.xml</a> <code>init-version</code> task
generates from a template 
<a href="lib/BridgeVersion.java.txt">lib/BridgeVersion.java.txt</a>.
To avoid updating <code>Version.java</code> whenever 
<code>build-properties.xml</code> changes, a task
<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/ant/taskdefs/VersionUptodate.java">
         src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/ant/taskdefs/VersionUptodate.java</a>
determines whether Version.java has the same version by scanning the source file.
The scan is dim-witted; do not change the lines flagged in the template 
without also changing the scanning code in the task.

<h4>Temporary aj-{name} and persistant aspectj-{name}</h4>
<p/>
Top-level temporary build directories are prefixed "aj-",
so you can safely destroy any such directory or ignore it
in CVS or the Eclipse package explorer.  By default the build script
puts them at the same level as other modules.  In build scripts, property names 
follow a similar convention; those prefixed "aj-" may be deleted at will, while
"aspectj-" names are source directories which should never be deleted.

<h4>Building Java 5 sources</h4>
<p/>
Java 5 source is supported in <code>{module}/java5-src</code> directories.
Under Ant, when building in a pre-Java-5 VM, this source will be ignored
(hence, it must not be required to compile).  Under Eclipse, developers
not using Java 5 should close the corresponding modules.

<h4>Builder.properties, resources, and tree audit tests</h4>
<p/>
In <a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties">
		src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/build/Builder.properties</a>
you can set up 
<ul>
	<li>product aliases for mapping module jars</li>
	<li>libraries to exclude for assembling module jars</li>
	<li>patterns for copying resources.</li>
</ul>
Regarding the patterns, if you add a resource with an unrecognized suffix to a
source tree, the corresponding unit test in 
<a href="testsrc/BuildModuleTests.java">testsrc/BuildModuleTests.java</a>
will fail.  You'll need to update the <code>Builder.properties</code>
file (and recreate the build.jar) to ensure that the new resource
is copied to the assembled module jar.
	
<h3>Debugging build problems</h3>
<h4>Running under Eclipse</h4>
When running Ant from eclipse,
do not use the default Eclipse Ant classpath; remove those jars and
add all the libraries in <a href="../lib/ant/lib">../lib/ant/lib</a>
as well as in <a href="../lib/junit">../lib/junit</a>.
If the build is failing under eclipse or Ant and the problem appears
to be in the build module, you can run the build directly in eclipse
(not using the Ant script) by running the skipped JUnit tests in
<a href="testsrc/org/aspectj/internal/build/ModulesTests.java">
	testsrc/org/aspectj/internal/build/ModulesTests.java</a>.
<p/>

<h4>Why new or changed modules might not work</h4>
The BuildModule taskdef makes some assumptions about the naming, 
position, and contents of module directories and files.  
Understand those (documented in 
<a href="src/org/aspectj/internal/tools/ant/taskdefs/BuildModule.java">
   BuildModule.java</a>) before using non-standard module directories. 

<h4>Silent classpath and build failures</h4>
<u>warning</u>: When Ant runs compile processes, sometimes Jar files
are not closed until the process quits.  When running Ant under Eclipse,
that means the jar files are not writable until eclipse quits.
This affects build products (e.g., installers) which are run under eclipse
(e.g., by opening with the "default system editor") and libraries used
when compiling under Javac (if not zip products or input).  This problem
presents as files not being writable, i.e., deleted or modified.
<p/>
One workaround is to delete any existing build products 
before re-creating them.  The problem with this is that Ant provides no 
notice of that deletes fail when deleting with quiet="on", but when not
running in quiet mode, deletes will fail if the directory does not exist.
The workaround-workaround would be to create any required directories 
before trying to deleting any files, with the result of creating unused
empty directories.

<p/>
Currently BuildModule tasks forks the Javac command to try to work around
this problem, but the Zip commands do not work around it.

If under Eclipse, you get strange behavior with Ant builds, clear 
out everything and build from the command line. In some cases, you
have to exit Eclipse before files can be deleted.  (*sigh*)
