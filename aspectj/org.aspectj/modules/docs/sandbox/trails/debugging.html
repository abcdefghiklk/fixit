<h3>Debugging AspectJ 1.0 Programs

The AspectJ 1.0 compiler produces .class files that have the
normal source file attribute and line information as well
as the information specified by JSR-045 required to debug
.class files composed of multiple source files.  
This permits the compiler to inline advice code 
into the .class files of the target classes; 
the advice code in the target class can have source 
attributes that point back to the aspect file.

<p>
Support for JSR-45 varies.
At the time of this writing, Sun's VM supports it, 
but not some others, which means that the Sun VM
must be used as the runtime VM.

Because the VM does all the work of associating the
source line with the code being debugged,
debuggers should be able to operate normally with
AspectJ 1.0 source files even if they weren't written
with that in mind, if they use the correct
API's to the debugger.  Unfortunately, some debuggers
take shortcuts based on the default case of one file
per class in order to avoid having the VM calculate
the file suffix or package prefix.  These debuggers
do not support JSR-45 and thus AspectJ.

<h3>Debugging AspectJ 1.1 Programs
</h3>

The AspectJ 1.1 compiler usually implements advice as 
call-backs to the aspect, which means that most
AspectJ programs do not require JSR-45 support in
order to be debugged.  However, it does do a limited
amount of advice inlining; to avoid this, use the
<code>-XnoInline</code> flag.
<p>
Because inlined advice can be more efficient, we
plan to support JSR-45 as soon as feasible. 
This will require upgrading the BCEL library we
use to pass around the correct source attributes.

<p>
Sometimes debuggers correctly get the source line information,
but fail when they attempt to parse AspectJ source files
expected to contain Java code.  For these it might be possible
to step into AspectJ code, but not to set breakpoints, or to
work around the parse errors by using <code>.aj</code> rather 
than <code>.java</code> as a file extension.
