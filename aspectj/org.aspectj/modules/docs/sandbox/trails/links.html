This contains links to other instances of AspectJ sample code.
It doesn't contain links to all articles that have AspectJ
sample code, but arguably it should.

<!--
The links should be written to render nicely and briefly in HTML,
but each source/topic should be segregated using different
sample tags.  Having this file make sense on its own would
be good as well.

<!-- START-SAMPLE pubs-papers-aodesignpatterns Aspect-Oriented Design Pattern Implementations -->
In the OOPSLA 2002 paper
	<u>Design Pattern Implementation in Java and AspectJ</u>
Jan Hannemann and Gregor Kiczales discuss the implementation in
AspectJ of 23 of the traditional "gang of four" design patterns
(from the book <u>Design Patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented
	software</u> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides).
Their paper and the code for those patterns are available from
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jan/AODPs/">
  	http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~jan/AODPs/
  </a>.
The code is also available from the AspectJ web site
  as <a href="ubc-design-patterns.zip">ubc-design-patterns.zip</a>.
  The latest version is checked into the CVS repository along with
  other sample code at 
  <code>org.aspectj/modules/docs/sandbox/ubc-design-patterns</code>.
  For instructions on downloading code from the CVS repository,
  see the <a href="doc/faq.html#q:buildingsource">FAQ entry "buildingsource"</a>.

<!-- START-SAMPLE pubs-projects-atrack ATrack bug tracker  -->
The <a href="https://atrack.dev.java.net/">aTrack project</a>
aims to create an open source bug tracking application that 
demonstrates use of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) with AspectJ. 
It uses AOP pragmatically to provide systematic support for 
technical, middleware, and business concerns.

The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cricketcage/">
CricketCage project</a>
automatically creates JUnit TestCases for repeatable bugs and test 
scenarios. Include Cricket Cage's AspectJ code to install a code 
generator, then run the program to generate the TestCase.
