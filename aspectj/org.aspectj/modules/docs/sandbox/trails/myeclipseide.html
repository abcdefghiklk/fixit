MyEclipseIde
(<a href="http://www.myeclipseide.com/">http://www.myeclipseide.com</a>)
aims to make it easy to develop J2EE applications using Eclipse.
AJDT 
(<a href="http://eclipse.org/ajdt">http://eclipse.org/ajdt</a>)
is an Eclipse plug-in that supports AspectJ. 
<ul>
<li>To install AJDT with MyEclipseIDE, direct the Eclipse update manager to
<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/technology/ajdt/dev/update">
      http://download.eclipse.org/technology/ajdt/dev/update</a>,
install the plug-in, and follow any post-install instructions.
</li>

<li>To enable a project to use aspects, first
select <code>Convert to AspectJ project</code>
from the project's context menu (select project, right click).
(XXX Bug: AJDT reverts perspective to Java; go back to MyEclipseIDE)
Note that you must convert each project;
converting the master J2EE project will not affect
the child components (XXX RFE: option to convert child if parent).
</li>

<li>To build, select the menu item <code>Project &gt; Rebuild Project</code>.
AJDT creates <code>default.lst</code> which lists all source files and
compiles them.  
You can also recompile by clicking the AJDT build button.
(XXX Bug:  only available in the Java perspective)
</li>

<li>To deploy, first add <code>aspectjrt.jar</code> to the project's
library directory.  
For servlets and JSP's, that is in <code>{Web Root}/WEB-INF/lib</code>.
For EJB's, it's XXX todo.
Then deploy as usual for your application server.
</li>
<li>If you are using AspectJ in more than one project,
you might instead deploy <code>aspectjrt.jar</code>
whereever shared libraries belong for your server.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs in MyEclipseIDE</h3>
<ol>
<li>After refactoring to rename a servlet, have to manually update web.xml</li>
<li>Silent failure when unable to delete a duplicate resource during deployment.</li>
<li>Annoyingly modal UI for deployment.  Use a view.</li>
<li>Need validation on saving Web.xml.  E.g., servlet mapping names validated with declared servlet names.</li>
<li>Deployment dirty flag not working; not updated after editing web.xml or rebuilding project.</li>
<li>Apparantly false JSP error?  using Sun page and template page,
    got:
    "Fatal error - The markup in the document preceding the root element 
     must be well-formed."
	Error persisted even after replacing the entire contents of the file
    with the template which worked by default.
</li>
<li>When using the exact template page, get no MyEclipseIDE error,
    but do get compile errors in Tomcat.  Using Javac, get compile-failed
    stack trace with initial line number.  Using ajc, just get stack trace.
	But precompiling using Ant seems to work.
    </li>
<li>Precompiling JSP's:  
  <ul> 
    <li>MyEclipseIDE has a command to compile all JSP's, but
    I don't see (where or how) the updated servlet mappings
    get into the deployed web.xml.
    It would be great to get this working with AJDT.
	</li>
	<li>I adapted the Tomcat precompile script to use AspectJ's iajc.
    This works fine, but like all Jasper2 solutions required the
    generated servlet mappings be copied manually into the web.xml file.
	See <a href="#j2ee-tomcat4-precompileJsp">the Ant build script</a>
	</li>
  </ul> 
    </li>
</ol>
