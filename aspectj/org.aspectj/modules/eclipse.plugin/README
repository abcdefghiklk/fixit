This project contains the files needed to build the Eclipse library and doc plugins for AspectJ.
The plugins themselves can only be built as the result of a master AspectJ build (../build/build.xml).

During a build the docs are copied into the doc subdir of the doc plugin,
the built libraries are copied into the ajde plugin, and the source jars
are created and placed in the scr dir of the source plugin.
