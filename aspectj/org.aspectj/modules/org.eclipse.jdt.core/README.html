    <h1>The Eclipse JDT Compiler</h1>

    <p>This module exports jdtcore.jar to anyone who depends on it.  That .jar
      contains a lightly modified version of the eclipse JDT compiler and all of its 
      dependencies.  The .jar is built from shadows/org.eclipse.jdt.core.  See
      shadows/README.html for more information.
