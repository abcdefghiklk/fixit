    <h1>Placeholder for the Shadow version of the Eclipse JDT Compiler</h1>

    <p>This module is here so that the org.eclipse.jdt.core project can
    fulfill its project dependencies when not working with the 'real'
    shadow version of org.eclipse.jdt.core (the normal mode). It contains
    a build.xml file that does nothing, in order to satisfy the external
    builder tool added to the chain of the org.eclipse.jdt.core HEAD project.
