that pick up test titles from -traceTestsMin harness output
(where lines start with PASS or FAIL).

All other lines should be ignored, as should the Suite.Spec summary.

PASS run and pass()
stuff

 FAIL omit if skipKeyword() Not this line either

more stuff

with empty lines

FAIL Suite.Spec(ignore this line...)
