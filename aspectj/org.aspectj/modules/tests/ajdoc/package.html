This is an incomplete attempt to write regression tests for ajdoc by
comparison with javadoc.  It aims to run both tools against the 
same pure-java sources and compare the output line-by-line, assuming
they should be the same where non-AspectJ elements are concerned.
<p>
It relies entirely on CLASSPATH and PATH being set correctly, and it 
generates output directory in the current working directory.
<p>
General example of how to run:
<li>Compile the sources</li>
<li>Setup CLASSPATH, including compiled sources and JDK tools.jar (for javadoc)</li>
<li>Setup PATH, so that "java" invokes a 1.2 or later java vm </li>
<li>Invoke from the directory with input/ as a subdirectory:
<br><code>java JavadocCompareClassMode</code></li>
