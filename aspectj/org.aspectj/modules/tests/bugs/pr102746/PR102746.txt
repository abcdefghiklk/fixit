Would test with 

    <ajc-test dir="bugs/pr102746" title="log to file with -log in classpath">
        <compile files="lib/Lib.java" outjar="foo-logging.jar"/>
        <compile files="PR102746.java" classpath="foo-logging.jar"/>
    </ajc-test>

except that the harness is I think snooping for foo-logging.jar wrong.
