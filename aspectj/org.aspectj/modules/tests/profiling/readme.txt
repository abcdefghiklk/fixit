This folder contains an ant build script and supporting resources
that can be used for profiling the aspectj compiler and getting 
information about memory usage and compilation time.

"ant usage" will display usage information.

Reports of historical interest (for tracking improvements across releases
for example) are kept in the reference-data sub-folder.
