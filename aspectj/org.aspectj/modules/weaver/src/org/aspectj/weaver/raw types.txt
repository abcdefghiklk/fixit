Current situation with respect to raw types...

* We can create an unresolved type (typeKind = SIMPLE) by 
   UnresolvedType.forSignature or forName
   
* We can create an unresolved type (typeKind = RAW) by calling 
   UnresolvedType.forRawTypeName
   
   This method is called by...
    
   BcelWorld.addSourceObjectType when types in jar files or on the classpath are added to
   the weaver for processing. If the JavaClass is determined to be generic then a raw
   UnresolvedType is built and a ReferenceType constructed from that. A BcelObjectType is
   built using the Resolved raw type (and when it's generic signature is unpacked later that will
   be swapped out for the generic type). Then a generic type is created, the delegates of
   the generic and raw types are set to point to the BcelObjectType, and the generic type
   of the raw type is set to point to the generic type. The raw type is explicitly added into
   the typeMap.
   
   EclipseFactory.addSourceTypeBinding when adding a binding for a generic type during 
   completeTypeBindings. This is put into the world by calling world.lookupOrCreateName. 
   Then a generic type is created and the raw type's generic type is set to refer to it.
   
   EclipseFactory.fromBinding when processing a RawTypeBinding. A later call to resolve
   is responsible for adding this to the type map.
   
* World.resolve processing works as follows:

   in resolveObjectType, if the typeKind of the UnresolvedType is neither parameterized
   nor generic, then a new ReferenceType is created using the rawTypeSignature of the
   unresolved type. Then the delegate is created, and if this turns out to be generic then a 
   generic type is also built and set as the generic type of the reference type (but nothing
   sets the type of the reference type to raw???).
   
   in resolveTheGenericType the rawTypeSignature is looked up in the typeMap.  If it
   is not found, then a new UnresolvedType is created forSignature, resolved (see above),
   and put in the type map. The generic type is then created and set as the generic type
   of the raw type.
