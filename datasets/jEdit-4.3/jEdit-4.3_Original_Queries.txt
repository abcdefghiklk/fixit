Folding: handling newlines at the start of closed folds  Here is the example text folded using explicit folding: 1| //{{{ 2| Folding 3| Test 4| Case 5| //}}} 6| Other text which folds to: 1| //{{{ [4 lines] 6| Other text By placing the caret after the last brace and pressing return we get the following result: 1| //{{{ 2| New text entered 7| Other text In the editor the fold is now showen as unfolded, but the text within the fold is not displayed. To display the contents of the fold you have to close the fold and open it again which then would display the expected text: 1| //{{{ 2| New text entered 3| Folding 4| Test 5| Case 6| //}}} 7| Other text This error appears to exist with any folding plugin, not just explicit folding. Secondly, with explict folding only, placing the caret between the braces that make up the start of the fold whilst folded and pressing return causes the fold to be 'lost'. As in the space taken up by the fold is still indicated by jEdit but the fold is no longer displayed: 1| //{{ 2| ^{ 7| Other text There are three ways to get the fold back. 1) Delete the new line and whitespace entered. This returns the fold in a closed position 2) Add new braces to complete the fold marker. This adds the fold in an open position but without the origenal text displayed. Closing and reopening the fold corrects this, the same as the first bug. 3) Reopen the file KeeperOfTheSoul <ex@dynafus.com>

The editor text area is not properly recognizing Indic input  The editor text area is not properly recognizing Unicode Indic(Sanskrit) input on Windows 2000. I am using the Windows 2000 IME "Sanskrit, Devanagari - INSCRIPT" for inputting the Devanagari(Sanskrit) letters. I am attaching the screenshots of the word "Sanskritam" typed in Windows notepad and the JEdit. The Notepad is displaying the word properly, but the JEdit is not displaying it properly.

folding bug, text is in a black hole  Hi, when you have some folded text(folding closed) {{{ test aaaa bbbb cccc }}} Close it you'll get {{{ test [4 lines] Delete one { You'll have {{ test and no text fold anymore. It seems really dangerous isn't it ? But the weird thing is that the text is not completely lost because you can type another {(no need to undo) and the fold will reappear magically. So the text was still here but hidden by jEdit's text area

Size of file open/save dialogs incorrect on dual displays  The size of the open/save dialog is incorrectly calculated/restored when the dialog is displayed on the second display on a dual display system(Windows XP). Basically, if the dialog opens on the secondary display, then the previous size and position is lost. Here are the tests I have performed to explore the behaviour. If the dialog appears on the primary display, the width is correctly calculated/restore from previous settings. If the adjustments are made(with the dialog still on the primary display) then these are correctly restored on next opening of the dialog. This is the behaviour I would expect. If the dialog appears on the secondary display, previous size and position settings are lost. I think that the width of the dialog is being determined by the minimum width of the tree component in the dialog.(See attachment). Any resizing of the dialog(with the dialog still on the secondary display) is lost the next time it is open. This is abnormal behaviour. If the dialog is opened on the secondary display, resized and dragged it to the primary display. The size and position settings are restored on next open.

Incorrect Python code indentation   Hello. I have found a little bug: processing the "Indent Lines" command(CTRL + I) to the Python code causes the wrong identation of selected text. Example: Before: if(row +1) > self.grid.GetNumberRows(): self.table.data.append(obj) self.grid.AppendRows(1, True) else: self.grid.SetCellValue(row, 0, fileName) self.table.data.append(obj) self.grid.AutoSizeColumn(0, True) after: if(row +1) > self.grid.GetNumberRows(): self.table.data.append(obj) self.grid.AppendRows(1, True) else: self.grid.SetCellValue(row, 0, fileName) self.table.data.append(obj) self.grid.AutoSizeColumn(0, True)

[notice] jEdit: jEdit version 4.3pre6 When I try to open a file(Ctrl-O) the focus in the filesystembrowser is on the Commands menu instead of the filename field. AFAICT this is because the GUIUtilities.requestFocus() method does not do its job. There was a patch to this method, see rev.5386: http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jedit/jEdit/trunk/ org/gjt/sp/jedit/GUIUtilities.java?r1=5372&r2=5386 prompted by a bug-report 1275607 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/ index.php?func=detail&aid=1275607&group_id=588&atid=300588 The bug was triggered by something else(find dialog), and the final messages of the bug report indicate that this particular patch was not needed for the bug resolution anyway. So my problem might possibly resolved by simply reverting this patch.(unfortunately, I do not have time to try that here) I don't have an idea about the reason for this bug. Can someone confirm this? cheers, stefan

4.3pre6 regexp find: hangs + huge memory waste  When you do "Find" or "Find and Replace" or "Replace All" with the regular expression "$"(match end of line), 4.3pre6 just hangs while its memory-usage meter thing in the bottom-right-hand-side of its status bar shows memory usage increasing exponentially! Also, this happens regardless of whether the search is performed within a selection, the current buffer, all buffers, or within a directory. To reproduce this bug: 1. Make a new buffer with this content: foo bar baz 2. Select all the text(C-a) 3. Open search&replace dialog(C-f) 4. Type the following regexp in the "search for" field: $ 5. Enable the "regular expressions" check-box(A-x) 7. Press the "Find" or "Find and Replace" or "Replace All" button. 8. Observe that jEdit now hangs, and its memory usage is rapidly increasing(look at memory usage stats at bottom-right-hand-corner of status bar). The expected result is that jEdit should NOT hang and the search should be performed correctly. Thanks for your attention.

I've tried to call ParserRuleSet::resolveImports() recursively at the beginning for the rulesets it processes, but this can cause infinite loops. If IMPORTS of "infinite" depth wouldn't be supported, that would make sense, but only rules with already existing hash/index chars get applied seems to be a bug somewhere.((( Use case: I want to use this for the php.xml mode file, so that I import a list of regular expressions for function definitions into a rule set, where the regular KEYWORDs are defined, so that the keywords get highlighted as supposed, but the regular expressions(one for each hash char) are recognized also, not overriding the highlighting of the KEYWORDs.)))

Fix invalid selection in newly opened buffer  Reproduction recipe of the problem: 1. Open an arbitrary buffer and select some texts. 2. Create a new file without jEdit. The path of this file must not be in jEdit's history. 3. Open the file with jEdit. After the above steps, the selection in newly opened buffer is not cleared(remains at same offsets in step 1). If the new file is longer than offsets of the selection, the selection appears in the new buffer. Otherwise, accessing to the selected offsets results in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. I found this problem while testing the recent changes to ColumnRuler plugin. In this case, the exception is thrown by paint() method of ColumnRuler, and jEdit gives up the remaining paint operation. This small patch will fix the problem.

Provide a way of reloading changed buffers without prompting  Warning when a buffer is beeing reloaded is wise as a general rule, but sometimes there are files you're editing that you *know* will change. Typical examples are: - system log files - reports of unit tests Then it would be useful to have these buffers beeing reloaded without beeing prompted. A trivial though not ideal solution would be to add a 4th option "autmatic reload, no confirmation" to the saving global option. A better solution would be to provide a per-buffer option, e.g. "don't prompt when reloading" It would also be very useful, at least to me, to turn off this prompt in a macro, that is, if this option was available in the bean shell

soft wrap, cut and null-pointer exception  I edit larger texts with soft wrap turned on. If I cut a text fragment that is larger then the text view, and then move back to the beginning of the text buffer by using the cursor keys, Page-Up or Ctrl-Home, I usually get a NullPointerException. Steps to reproduce: - load http://www.jedit.org/users-guide/starting.html - set buffer line wrap = soft, wrap at 80 characters - cut lines 5 to 45 - press Ctrl-Home This results in a BeanShell error dialog. The beginning of the text buffer is then missing in the display. I have attached a log of the exception. I have confirmed this error in jEdit 4.3pre7, 4.3pre6, and 4.3pre3. This works fine in 4.3pre2. I could not test it in 4.3pre1 due to another bug involving soft wrap.

Rectangular Selection and Dragging  [cut 'n' pasted from slava on jedit-devel] Hi, I found a way to reproduce an obscure rectangular selection bug that I've been seeing recently.

What actually happens is the selection extends a few characters to the right, even though you are dragging straight down. Does anybody feel like taking a look at this? Slava

system icons for files in FSB  I'm missing an option to "Use system icons for files" in FSB like Project Viewer has.

"Toggle Tree View" broken  If doing "Toggle Tree View" in HyperSearch Results window context menu, it doesn't switch properly, means if switching back to show the path and filename in one line, the path is missing.

automatically hide HyperSearch Results  If all nodes got removed from HyperSearch Results, either manually or with the clear button, the dockable should hide, because you have no benefit from it anymore until you do a new search which brings it up automatically.

Save the editmode for Recent files  If you e. g. open build.properties.sample and change the editmode to "properties", then you close that file and then reopen it, you again have to change the editmode manually. This should be done automatically, at least for the files in the recent files list.

Autoindenting should copy exact whitespaces  If autoindenting copies the indentation of last line the indentation should be done the same way it was copied from, e. g. currently if Soft tabs are enabled, always spaces are inserted, even if the previous line is indented with literally tabs or tabs and spaces mixed. The whitespaces should simply be copied from the line that the auto-indenting is taken from.

embedd optionspanes into JScrollPanes  The optionspanes(general and plugins) should be embedded into a JScrollPane, so that the dialog stays at the size the user had chosen and doesn't resize always just because a settings pane is shown that needs more space. For some the settings panes are so huge, that the complete dialog doesn't fit on the screen anymore.

Incremental search should tell if string was found  Hi, I think the incremental search textbox should tell if the searched string was found or not(like Firefox does). I tried on my copy to put a red background, I think it really helps. Do you think I should add it to jEdit ?

Indentation of Javascript embedded in HTML is broken  Hi, Code indentation does not work for Javascript code in a <script> block in HTML mode. Indentation works OK in .js files in javascript mode. Adding html to the javascript fileglob "*.{js,html}" forces HTML into Javascript mode, indentation works OK, but HTML is not highlighted/indented correctly. Environment: Windows XP Home SP2 java version "1.5.0_08" Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition(build 1.5.0_08-b03) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM(build 1.5.0_08-b03, mixed mode) jEdit 4.3pre8 Thanks

Need action to reload buffer with different encoding  Open the attached textfile that I created with jEdit 4.3pre8. You'll see some squares instead of the Slovak characters. The encoding cp-1250 was used when I created the file and I expect that jEdit will recognize this when I open the file. Perhaps this isn't possible but when I set the buffer encoding manually to cp-1250 the characters are still displayed with the wrong encoding although the status bar tells me that the encoding cp-1250 is now active and used. Besides this bug it would be in general nice to have a menu entry to show opened files in different encodings. This should be like the menu "View -> Character Encoding" in Firefox.

NPE with JEditBuffer and new indenting  The indenting refactoring introduced some NullPointerExceptions. I've "catched" one in r8096, but as stated in the commit message, it's probably an error further up. r8096 should be reverted. The problem seems to be that ctx.rules.getModeName() returns null, while it should return the main rule name. To reproduce: Save an empty buffer as test.php. Type: --------------- <?php $foo = '<ENTER> --------------- When pressing ENTER, after the "'", the following exception gets thrown: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.JEditBuffer.getIdealIndentForLine(JEditBuffer.java:991) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.buffer.JEditBuffer.indentLine(JEditBuffer.java:907) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.insertEnterAndIndent(TextArea.java:4327) at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor23.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source) at bsh.Reflect.invokeMethod(Reflect.java:134) at bsh.Reflect.invokeObjectMethod(Reflect.java:80) at bsh.Name.invokeMethod(Name.java:858) at bsh.BSHMethodInvocation.eval(BSHMethodInvocation.java:75) at bsh.BSHPrimaryExpression.eval(BSHPrimaryExpression.java:102) at bsh.BSHPrimaryExpression.eval(BSHPrimaryExpression.java:47) at bsh.BSHBlock.evalBlock(BSHBlock.java:130) at bsh.BSHBlock.eval(BSHBlock.java:80) at bsh.BshMethod.invokeImpl(BshMethod.java:362) at bsh.BshMethod.invoke(BshMethod.java:258) at bsh.BshMethod.invoke(BshMethod.java:186) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.BeanShell.runCachedBlock(BeanShell.java:509) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.BeanShellAction.invoke(BeanShellAction.java:76) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.InputHandler.invokeAction(InputHandler.java:415) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.InputHandler.invokeAction(InputHandler.java:381) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.DefaultInputHandler.handleKey(DefaultInputHandler.java:373) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.input.AbstractInputHandler.processKeyEventKeyStrokeHandling(AbstractInputHandler.java:116) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.InputHandler.processKeyEvent(InputHandler.java:184) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.processKeyEvent(TextArea.java:4572) at java.awt.Component.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager.redispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.dispatchKeyEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.preDispatchKeyEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.typeAheadAssertions(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source)

Support for "thick" caret  I've attached a patch for a new configuration option, "thick caret"(in Global options -> Text area). When selected, this causes the caret to be painted slightly wider than the current default. Personally I believe it makes the caret easier to see(as well as better looking, but that might be because I'm used to it from other editors of course). What's with the -devel mailing list btw? Seems I'm unable to subscribe or send mail to it..

Filter box lose focus bug  I had to do this for a class, so since I fixed it I might as well submit it as a patch. I tried creating a diff, but since I didn't sync it with the jEdit CVS server I was not able to create one. But as it says on your website I will just post it here. *********THE BUG:********* Under the File System Browser, used to open and save files, the Filer textbox doesn't become deselected after it loses focus. To replicate this: 1) Run jEdit 2) Select File->Open 3) Click in the Filter textbox and then click in a different box such as the File Name text box. As you can see the text in the Filter textbox is still selected and/or the caret is still blinking as if it has keyboard focus. *********THE FIX:********* The function protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e) in HistoryComboBoxEditor is where the problem is. HistoryComboBoxEditor is a subclass of org.gjt.sp.jedit.browser.VFSBrowser.java. The correct code is: protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e) { // AWT will call setItem() when the editor loses // focus; that can cause weird and unwanted things // to happen, so ignore lost focus events. if(e.getID() != FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) super.processFocusEvent(e); //NEW CODE ADDED BY JAY else { setCaretPosition(0); this.getCaret().setVisible(false); } ///end NEW CODE } This restores the default behavior of what usually happens when the focus is lost. I hope this is helpful to you all.

avoid NPE from getIndentRules()  At jEdit trunk r8210, I saw a NPE from getIndentRulse(). I could reproduce it with [Record Temporary Macro] > [Stop Recording]. The attached patch will fix this problem. Though the patch is working fine, I don't know why lineMgr.getLineContext(line) returns null with the above operation. I made this patch to be the least change to avoid an actual problem. But the function seemed to rely on some unclear non-null assumptions. - tokenMarker.getMainRuleSet() - getMainRuleSet().getModeName() - jEdit.getMode(modeName) - getMode(modeName).getIndentRules() If these can be problems, I think the patch should be revised.

Escaped quotes messed up(since pre9)  Hello All, Attached file showcases a bug with the PHP syntax highlighting.

As of SVN revision 8320, I can recreate this on a full "native install"(dist) on a Mac 10.4.8, Intel Core Duo. Kevin

Improve keyboard interaction in HyperSearch Results  This patch will improve some keyboard interaction in the [HyperSearch Results] tree. * Two flavors [Space], [Enter] to open the node. Pressing [Space] opens the selected node without changing the focus.(The focus remains on the [HyperSearch Results] tree.) Pressing [Enter] opens the selected node and set the focus to the textArea. Without this patch, the latter requires 3 strokes [Enter]+[Ctrl+E]+[Ctrl+J]. * Enable [Delete] key to remove the node. Without this patch, removing nodes can be done only with mouse(context menu). I also implemented adjusting the selection on removal so that repeating some removals behave naturally. P.S. I found the two flavors to open buffers in the macro Files/Buffer_Switcher.bsh. I like this interface very much. I would like to see this interface in all tree or list interface about buffers in jEdit. ErrorList, ProjectViewer and Sidekick are in mind. If you like this patch, I'll try to implement this interface for these plugins.

Auto-indent breaks if previous line is a single line indent  Damn I hate these small summary fields. I also hate the auto-inserted word-wrap in these text fields, BTW. </rant> Anyway, this might be a dupe of some of the other several auto-indent bugs, but I took some time to look at this one and have a good idea of what's going on(though I haven't looked at how to fix it just yet). The problem is with a piece of code like this, for example(in a mode like C or Java): if(foo) bar; for(;;) { As soon as you hit "{" the line will be indented to the same level as "bar;", which is wrong. This is because in JEditBuffer.java:getIdealIndentForLine(), "oldIndent" is initialized to the indent size of the last non-empty line. In this case this is wrong, since the last non-empty line is at a different indent level than the current indent line. The code needs to check what's the auto-indent level for the next line after the last non-empty line, instead of just using the same indent level.

4.3pre15: RegEx can't be used to find zero width match  Hello Thanks again for a wonderful programmers' word processor. In jEdit 4.3pre2, you can quickly add a comma(or anything else) to the end of every line by 1. Press Ctrl-F 2. Check "Regular expressions" 3. Enter $ under 'Search for' 4. Enter , under 'Replace with' 5. Pressing Alt-A The above would match the end of the line, and add a comma to the end. In jEdit 4.3pre9, this does not happen. You have to instead match a character AND the end of the line. If you want to match empty lines, you have to 'Search For'(\n)$ and 'Replace with' ,$1 or $1, but this only has the desired affect for every second line. Using 'Search for' $(\n) and 'Replace with' ,$1 matches all but the last line in the buffer. In jEdit 4.3pre2, $ alone on its own would match the end of the line BEFORE the \n. And this would give the desired effect. Best regards Carlos

Bad EBMessage from HyperSearch Results  Using jEdit development version, SVN rev 9867. When double-clicking an item in the HyperSearch Results window, the corresponding file is opened in a buffer, but the BufferUpdate.LOADED message that is sent when the buffer has been loaded comes with a null view instead of the actual view in which it is opened. The null view causes the SideKick plugin to ignore this message, so it doesn't update its SideKick tree for the buffer(which is now the active buffer).

patch to configure file status checking  Attached is a patch to fix the following problem: steps to reproduce: 1. Mount a remote filesystem across the internet [1]. 2. Open several files from that location via jEdit 3. Move focus to an application other than jEdit 4. Move focus back to jEdit actual behavior: jEdit freezes for multiple seconds as the app checks file status for each buffer. expected behavior: Buffer should be editable immediately. The patch adds a combo box to GlobalOptionPane that controls when jEdit checks file status. The new option reads: === prompt == Check for file change upon: === values == application focus application focus, visiting the buffer or saving any buffer visiting the buffer or saving any buffer visiting or saving the buffer saving the buffer State for this configuration option is stored in a new integer property named 'checkFileStatus'. The patch implements this new behavior. In case you're curious, here's a short description of the use case satisfied by each option: --- 1 Making 'application focus' the default option avoids introducing new overhead and retains behavior that plugins may expect. This option could be dropped if those goals aren't important. --- 2 The 'application focus, visiting[...]' option is useful in an environment where multiple users may edit a file simultaneously. --- 3 The 'visiting the buffer or saving any buffer' option defers notification of file changes until the user is at a natural pausing point in workflow. --- 4 The 'visiting or saving the buffer' option deals well with many files where checking file attributes has high latency, such as in the sshfs-attached filesystem scenario that motivated this patch. --- 5 The 'saving the buffer' option disables checking file attributes except during save and exit. This can be helpful when a network-attached filesystem is intermittently unavailable or unresponsive. [1] I use sshfs w/ compression enabled. http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html

Syntax highlighting: Easy configuration of syntax styles  Currently, the syntax styles(token type settings used for syntax highlighting) in jEdit are configurable only using the Syntax Highlighting option pane of the Global Options dialog. This is not user friendly, since users do not normally know what each token type means for the specific mode(s) they're using. For example, if I want to configure the style of C++ variables, I need to match the style of a variable in some C++ buffer against the various token types in the option pane. If there are multiple token types with the same style, I need to try each one, click 'apply' and check how it affects the coloring in the buffer until I find which token type corresponds to C++ variables. I think the following would make it much easier for users to customize the styles: Provide an action that finds the token type under the caret, and opens the syntax style dialog for that token type. This way, the user doesn't even need to know the token types, he can simply put the caret on a variable, invoke the action and configure the style for variables. Later, this mechanism can be extended to provide mode-specific colors(i.e. override the global settings, like with the Editing option pane) - the style dialog can have a check-box to specify whether to set the global or mode-specific style for the token type, and jEdit can override the global settings with mode-specific ones whenever the mode is changed. But that's for another feature request, for now there's no need.

fix for getXMLEncoding()  Hello, attached patch is for org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/XMLEncodingDetector.java(Revision 10456) The function Charset.isSupported() does not return false if an unsupported encoding is given but throws an IllegalCharsetNameException. Therefore it is not possible to open files with a wrong/unsupported encoding or use hypersearch in directories that contain such files. The bug can be reproduced by creating a file with the following line in it: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="{@CHARSET}"?>(this is part of a template file from wotlab burning board 3) The fix catches this exception, adds a message to the log and returns null.

I basically just added an anonymous KeyAdapter that responds to the escape key and sets the text field's text back to the current path of the browser.

[ 1887293 ] Incremental Search Bar always disappears  This is my first patch submission, so I apologize if I'm not following standard customs. I was able to replicate this behavior on Mac OS X Leopard, but only when changing the "Always show search bar" checkbox in Global Options after startup. The corresponding state within the SearchBar object(previously stored in private member 'temp') wasn't being updated after pressing either Apply or OK from the Global Options dialog. It looks like the state of the checkbox was being followed only upon startup. So, here are the changes that I've tried and which I'm submitting as a patch: 1) Renamed SearchBar.temp to 'isRemovable' to better describe what it's supposed to be storing. 2) Moved much of the code that was previously in SearchBar.propertiesChanged() to a new private method, SearchBar.setCloseButtonVisibility(). This is because the SearchBar constructor was calling propertiesChanged() but the properties may not have been changed. 3) In the View class, moved the invocation of searchBar.propertiesChanged() so that it's called regardless of whether the "Always show search bar" is checked or not. The previous version updated the Search Bar's state only if the check box is checked.

Let the TextArea has 8 visible lines. Write 3 empty lines. Now write one line, that spans at least 3 screenlines. Now write some empty lines below the last line, so that the scrollbar is shown on the right side. Now delete the line above the one, that spans several lines and look at the scrollbar. it's getting smaller each time you delete the line above the long one. 2nd example) This relates to another bug, where an exception occurs sometimes at scrolling down after deleting a softwrapped line. Open jEdit and take a clean buffer. Let the TextArea has 8 visible lines. Be sure, that the last line is not partially visible. Write something into the first line so that it spans two screenlines. Now write 9 further short lines so that you have 10 physical lines in total - 2 more than visible. Now select the whole first line(Selection from the very beginning of the first screenline until the very beginning of the third screenline) and remove it(Ctrl-X). You see that, for no reason, the scrollbar disappears. Now scroll down(with Array-Down-Key) to the very last line of the buffer. You will get the following exception: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.scrollTo(TextArea.java:1009) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.scrollToCaret(TextArea.java:873) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea._finishCaretUpdate(TextArea.java:5101) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.finishCaretUpdate(TextArea.java:5260) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.moveCaretPosition(TextArea.java:2365) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.moveCaretPosition(TextArea.java:2331) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.moveCaretPosition(TextArea.java:2320) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea._changeLine(TextArea.java:5375) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.goToNextLine(TextArea.java:2589) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.Reflect.invokeMethod(Reflect.java:134) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.Reflect.invokeObjectMethod(Reflect.java:80) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.Name.invokeMethod(Name.java:855) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BSHMethodInvocation.eval(BSHMethodInvocation.java:75) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BSHPrimaryExpression.eval(BSHPrimaryExpression.java:102) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BSHPrimaryExpression.eval(BSHPrimaryExpression.java:47) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BSHBlock.evalBlock(BSHBlock.java:130) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BSHBlock.eval(BSHBlock.java:80) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BshMethod.invokeImpl(BshMethod.java:362) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BshMethod.invoke(BshMethod.java:258) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.bsh.BshMethod.invoke(BshMethod.java:186) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.BeanShellFacade.runCachedBlock(BeanShellFacade.java:224) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.BeanShell.runCachedBlock(BeanShell.java:443) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.BeanShellAction.invoke(BeanShellAction.java:76) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.InputHandler.invokeAction(InputHandler.java:383) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.InputHandler.invokeAction(InputHandler.java:349) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.DefaultInputHandler.handleKey(DefaultInputHandler.java:197) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.input.AbstractInputHandler.processKeyEventKeyStrokeHandling(AbstractInputHandler.java:364) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.InputHandler.processKeyEvent(InputHandler.java:152) at org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.TextArea.processKeyEvent(TextArea.java:4731) at java.awt.Component.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.processEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.KeyboardFocusManager.redispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.dispatchKeyEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.preDispatchKeyEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.typeAheadAssertions(Unknown Source) at java.awt.DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Container.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source) at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(Unknown Source) at java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source) I figured out, that in org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.Anchor.preContentRemoved(int,int,int) the scrollLine count is updated so that it reflects the correct value after the remove operation. But in a next step org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.BufferHandler.doDelayedUpdate() is called which calls in turn org.gjt.sp.jedit.textarea.DisplayManager.updateScreenLineCount() for the line, where the removed content started. This method then calls DisplayManager.updateScreenLineCount() for that line. Because the value was invalidated before, it is now recalculated. But in this recalculation(especially in DisplayManger.setScreenLineCount()) also the scrollLineCount.scrollLine is updated by the difference to the previous screenLineCount of that line. I would liketo fix this bug, but I don't know which side-effects it would have not to update the scrollLine in setScreenLineCount. Can anybody give some response? I think, this bug also results in some of the NPE occuring at scrolling sometimes. Thanks, zoniie

4.3pre13, r11659 - Center Caret On Screen action  In the revision 11659 was changed behaviour of the "Center Caret On Screen" action(C + e C + n): "- Center Caret On Screen now scrolls your document so your caret doesn't change. [ 1883809 - ezust ]" But for that purpose we have the "Scroll to Current Line"(C + e C + j) action. The "Center Caret On Screen" action is supposed to change the caret position.

reverse regex search  I have implemented support for reverse searching with regular expressions. This works by searching in the forward direction and accepting the last match prior to the current match. Thus it's functional for small-to-moderate sized buffers, but not too efficient for very large buffers. Since I think most folks are using jEdit for source editing, not grepping massive log files, I'm hoping this is an acceptable tradeoff.

4.3pre13: Appends number to text when using autocomplete  When selecting a completion in the autocomplete popup by number, the number is appened to the text. How to reproduce: 1. Create a new buffer 2. Type in: foo foobar 3. Type in fo and hit Ctrl-B for autocomplete. The autocomplete popup displays the two alternatives 1: foo 2: foobar 4. Type 2 to select the second alternative. fo will be completed to foobar2 instead of foo.

Fix for Activity Log filter that causes jEdit to freeze  Occasionally, typing rapidly in the filter text box on the Activity Log will cause jEdit to freeze with 100% CPU activity. The problem is caused by the rapid changing of the filter text not happening on the awt event dispatch thread. This patch simply wraps the contents of the FilteredListModel.setFilter method with a runnable that is then called with SwingUtilities.invokeLater. Patch to be applied to org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.FilteredListModel.java. Patch created against revision 12387.

Expanding a fold twice moves caret unexpectedly  I'm using 4.3pre13 on Debian Testing(with Java 1.6.0_04) and on Ubuntu Feisty(with Java 1.5.0_11). I get the same results on both machines. Create the following file, and save it as test.cpp: int a = 1; void bcd() { // } void efg() { // } void hij() { // } Change the folding mode(if necessary) to `indent'. Move the caret to the `hij' line. Press Alt+Backspace to contract the fold. It works. Press Alt+Enter to expand the fold. It works. Press Alt+Enter a second time. The caret moves unexpectedly to the `bcd' line. I think this is a bug: I think the caret should stay where it is, and jEdit should either do nothing or print an error message.

Show the search string in the HyperSearch Results dockable  It would be useful to see the search string in the HyperSearch Results dockable, possibly as part of the label at the top, both if results were found or not. Currently, during search, it just specifies "Searching ..."(and also the file being currently searched), and when the search is over it just specifies "Done" or "Not found". It would be useful to see the search string as part of the label as well(possibly truncated to some logical width).

Customize Tool Bar and Context Menu: Reset  Button  Both the Tool Bar and Context Menu edit pane should contain a Reset button to get rid of the customizations. Causes: Customizing Tool Bar or Context Menu does override the whole Menu/Tool Bar definition. When jEdit is updated and the old personal settings will be used on, changes of the delivered Context Menu/Tool Bar will be invisible until the customizations are removed from the properties file. Additional, icon assignments for the customized actions of the Tool bar are saved to the properties file. They should be removed too.

'n' key in file system browser  Pressing 'n' with the file system browser dockable open, and the file list focused, opens a new file. This is really annoying, because it makes keyboard completion useless. If I want to open a new file, I can just press C+n. With this "feature"(clearly added by someone not familiar with jEdit's features) I cannot complete filenames by typing them.

More efficient and general fix for black hole bug  I found joining lines is very slow only when folding mode is set to other than 'none'. Reproduction recipe:(WARNING: This will cause vary long hang up.) - Open doc/CHANGES.txt in jEdit source tree. - Do [Expand All Folds](C+e x).(without this, another bug happens.) - Do [Select All](C+a). - Try [Join Lines](C+j). This patch will speed up this situation by minimizing calls to buffer.getFoldLevel(). Also, this patch will expand the care about black hole bug to support ... - multi line edit including folded line - more folding modes other than 'explicit' - modification at the middle of folded range. I want approval from Matthieu who made the current fixes for the bugs.

No "File Not Saved" alert on close of untitled buffers  If I create a new buffer and immediately close it, or add text but delete it all, and then try to close the buffer, jEdit asks me if I would like to save the empty buffer. I've used other editors before, like notepad, for example, that doesn't ask you to save if the buffer is empty. That's not to say that you can't save an empty buffer, it just would require you to initiate the save command on your own. Frequently, I create new buffers, paste text into it, modify it, and cut it all to the clipboard; using the new buffer only as a temporary space to manipulate some text. In this scenario, I feel it would be beneficial to suppress that alert. What do you all think?

But a problem has been found while testing the patch. https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1923613 Repeating [Find Previous] for ".$" stops at every character. It should stop at every end of non-empty line. In contrast, repeating [Find Next] for "^." stops at every start of non-empty line. "$" looks matching at start position of reverse regex search.

DIRTY_CHANGED is not sent after emptying Untitled buffer  With r13466, sometimes BufferTabs shows wrong icon for Untitled buffer which is dirty. This seems to happen since r13446, or related changes. Reproduction recipe: 1. Open a new buffer. 2. Type 'a'. Now the buffer becomes dirty and DIRTY_CHANGED is sent over EditBus. 3. Type BS. Now the buffer becomes not dirty and DIRTY_CHANGED is sent. 4. Type 'a'. Now the buffer becomes dirty but DIRTY_CHANGED is not sent. Because of this, the icon on BufferTabs remain showing "new", but when I close this buffer, the prompt comes up. Then buffer.isDirty() gives true.

NPE in EditPane.setBuffer when quitting jEdit  When trying to quit jEdit, I get the following Null-Pointer-Exception, which is probably related to some files being changed/deleted(due to a "cvs up" in the background). Previously to trying to quit jEdit, the "Files have changed. Reload?" dialog already failed, so that "Close" was the only option that worked.

The fifth is not matched Now search for $ and replace with z Since the fifth line was not matched, z is placed on only the first 4 lines. Please note: -- ^ works fine. Just $ demonstrates this behaviour -- the lines do not have to be empty. This is reproducable for non-empty lines as well, and any mixture of empty non-empty lines

4.3pre16: files in buffer switcher not ordered  Tested against jEdit 4.3pre16(r13908) Instead of being ordered by filename, the buffer switcher is ordered by when the files were opened. To reproduce: Use touch to create two files in the same directory: foo.txt and bar.txt Set "Sort buffer sets" to On. Set "Sort buffer sets by filename, instead of pathname" to On. Open foo.txt in jEdit. Then open bar.txt in jEdit. Check the buffer switcher. Foo.txt is shown above bar.txt. This is true for the current view, and any new views(View->New View) that you then create. If you close jEdit then open it again, the switcher is ordered correctly(i.e. bar.txt then foo.txt)

Docking option pane: Configure dockables by plugin  When there are many plugins installed, there are usually also many dockables available. The Docking option pane in the Global Options dialog shows the entire list of dockables, ordered by their titles. There are two issues with this: 1. Sometimes, dockables from different plugins have the same title(e.g. "Tag List" exists both in Tags and in CtagsInterface, and soon also in Source Navigator), and it is therefore impossible to know which dockable I'm configuring - the one from Tags or the one from CtagsInterface. 2. The list of dockables becomes long, making it less convenient to configure the desired dockables. To solve these issues, the Docking option pane should have a combo-box for choosing the set of dockables to present in the table, similar to the combo-box in the Shortcuts option pane, so that the user can choose to configure the dockables of a specific plugin, or the core, or all, if desired.

When I choose "Directory of current buffer" from commands menu, it works ok. ~ and / options are working fine. There is also small inconsistency, because in search and replace dialog to current buffer points empty dropdown, not minus. Maybe in FileBrowser it should as well, but for now neither minus nor empty field points to current directory.

Highlight terms in HyperSearch Results Window/color for type  It would be a big increase in usability if the terms searched for were highlighted in the lines displayed in the hypersearch results window and the lines were colored for type(e.g. comments in "comment" color). When there are a lot of results, and the terms are only part of each line, it can be difficult to find the relevant ones. For example: I might search for the term "boolean" but I'm not interested in any cases where it appears in a comment, or where it's part of a method name. So instead of: public boolean doIt() { public void booleanChecker(int boolVal) { this appears in a multi-line comment about booleans I would see(excuse the HTML code): public <font style="color: BLUE;">boolean</font> doIt() { public void <font style="color: BLUE;">boolean</font>Checker(int boolVal) { <font style="color: GREEN;">this appears in a multi-line comment about <font style="color: BLUE;">boolean</font>s</font>

BufferTabs - Deleted file doesn't show as dirty buffer.  Unchanged, but deleted files are not appearing as dirty buffers as they did previously. Steps to reproduce: Create a file and save it. Now delete the file through normal OS methods. Go back to jEdit - you get the "File changed on disk" dialog. Click "close". Notice that the buffer is not marked dirty. Everything behaves as if it is non-existent on the filesystem - eg. Saving the file at this point brings up the file dialog to chose the save location. The buffer is just not marked as dirty as it was in previous versions.

Fix gutter width for line numbers  When line numbers are displayed in the gutter, a 5-digit width is always reserved for them, even if the buffer has less(e.g. 20 lines) or more(e.g. 200,000 lines). For a buffer with 20 lines, there will be redundant space reserved for the line numbers. For a buffer with 200,000 lines, the line numbers will be written on top of the fold markers. For a buffer with 2,000,000 lines, the first digit will be "cut" by the gutter boundary and not be completely visible.

Manually stop a HyperSearch operation/request  So there is the maximum results option that prompts you to stop or continue a HyperSearch, but it would be nice to have a manual stop button for that purpose. This patch does just that. A stop button is added using the default set of icons to the HyperSearch pane(next to highlight, clear, and multi-results buttons). IT is disabled when there is no search currently active, and enabled otherwise. To stop it I basically the mimicked the max-results mechanism, except I use a temporary property to indicate that the stop button was clicked(not to sure if this is the best way to handle it, but all I could think of and it works just fine).

line height correction(disappearing underscores)  Attached is a patch(against SVN r16059) which solves problem of underscores disappearing when the cursor is moved up and down the lines of the TextArea with the "DejaVu Sans Mono" at 15pt in jEdit from SVN trunk(r16059) under openjdk6-1.5-2-i686. The root cause was the underscore in this particular font descends below lineHeight and appears on the first pixel of the next line. So when the next line is drawn, the underscore of the current line is painted-over and it disappears. The solution used in the patch is to always draw one extra line above the first line being repainted, so that any underscores in the extra above line are preserved during the repaint. Thanks for your consideration.

Plain text copy from HyperSearch results  HyperSearch results used to get copied as plaint text some version before 4.3pre17. I used this for further processing. Now, it seems, that html is copied such that further processing of the results is interfered.
