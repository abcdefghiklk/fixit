SFTP transfers cause memory leaks under Mac OS X 10.4 and Java 1.5  "Under Mac OS X 10.4(Tiger), transferring files from and/or to an SFTP server causes the JVM to leak memory fast, leaking approximately the same amount of memory as the data transferred. This memory is never recovered, even if the garbage collector is called explicitly(System.gc()).  Steps to reproduce: - Launch muCommander under Mac OS X 10.4 with Java 1.5 - Copy a file from an SFTP server to a local volume(or vice-versa) - Using top or Activity Viewer.app, watch the memory usage grow and never go down as the transfer progresses  Additional information: - this happens with Java 1.5 and Java 1.6 DP but not with Java 1.4 - this bug cannot be reproduced under the newer Mac OS X 10.5(Leopard) - this bug cannot be reproduced under Windows XP - transfers with protocols other than SFTP(FTP, SMB, ...) do not cause this problem"

Corrupt listing of UNC paths  "Steps to reproduce: Enter a valid UNC path in the location bar. The path must point to a existing, non-empty directory.  Expected behaviour: The content of the specified directory should be properly listed.  Observed behaviour: - All files are displayed as symlinks. - All directories are displayed as files and as symlinks. - Some files don't have icons at all. The only example of that was the muCommander 0.8.2 Windows setup file."

Note that pressing alt, releasing it and then pressing the F key will open the File menu. It's only using both keys at the same time that dispatches the event to the wrong component."

"0.8.1(and current nightly) has two issues with the 'Swap folders' functionality. The first one is the most critical one as it can cause the renaming of unwanted files. Here are the steps to reproduce both issues :  1)  - On the right panel, swap the order of the Name and Extension columns, making the Name column appear before the Extension one - Swap folders - Rename a file in the right panel by clicking on the name cell, changing its name and validating by pressing enter  Expected result : the file selected in the RIGHT panel is renamed with the new name entered Actual result : a file in the LEFT panel-ï¿½is renamed with the new name entered  2) - On the right panel, hide all columns so that only the Name column remains - Swap folders  Expected result : folders are swapped Actual result : muCommander crashes, leaving the main window unpainted(cf attached screenshot)  Note that these 2 issues have been grouped into a single bug because the underlying cause is the same."

Overwriting a Zip file can sometimes result in a corrupted archive  "Steps to reproduce: - create a Zip file , say '~/test.zip', that contains a somewhat large file. - mark a somewhat small file and pack it('File' -> 'Pack files...' menu item) into the same Zip file, i.e. '~/test.zip'. - when the file collision dialog appears, warning that the file already exists in the destination, choose 'Overwrite'.  Expected result : => the new Zip file contains the 'somewhat small file', and the archive file is smaller than the previous one.  Actual result : => when entered with muCommander, the new Zip file still contains the old 'somewhat large' file and has the same size as the previous one. Futhermore, the new Zip is corrupted: running 'unzip -vt' will reveal errors in the Zip file.  Note: if the new Zip file is larger than the existing one, everything is fine(no bug)."

--no-splash should be a checkbox in the Preferences dialogue  "Hi.  I have nothing agaist the design of the splash screen. It's neat. But splash screens annoy me in general: they hover on top of the window you want to work in just to show that, yes, the program whose symbol you just clicked, does indeed start up. And I have found that often the splash screens slow down start-up. With muCommander my impression is that start-up is almost twice as fast without splash, even on a dual-core AMD(2 GHz) with 2 Gigs of RAM. Now, I found the forum post that told me to add the --no-splash as a start-up parameter. On Linux, you have to be root to do that(considering muCommander has been installed systemwide by root; the startup script is in /usr/share/mucommander/). Hmmm. Also, for Windows, I will have to check on Monday and edit the respective setting. Not really userfriendly towards the average GUI user. If possible, it would be great if you could add a ""[ ] show splash screen at start-up"" checkbox somewhere in the Preferences dialogue(by the way: German translation may be: ""[ ] zeige Startbild"" -- even better(and simpler) would be a check box ON the start-up screen ""[ ] don't show this again"" ...  Best regards  Andreas"

When we type in the LocationTextField name of bookmark with non existed(but not malformed) location, there is a different outcome - after the error dialog appears, the text in the text-field is not selected and the focus is at the file-table. It seems that the outcome of the 2 cases above should be the same - In both cases a non existed location(again, not malformed) was entered in the LocationTextField, and the first outcome is the desired one."

Tree view sometimes causes a deadlock on startup  "Steps to reproduce : - Enable the tree view on the left panel - Quit muCommander(the tree view setting is persisted in the preference file) - Start muCommander  Expected behavior : - muCommander starts normally  Actual behavior : - the application fails to start properly: the left panel is not painted and UI is totally unresponsive  Additional information: - both startup folders are local folders, which means that the error is not caused by a stalled network filesystem. - this bug has been reproduced with the current SVN trunk running on Mac OS X 10.5 with Java 1.6.  I have generated a full stack trace that confirms the presence of a deadlock and shows where it occurs, I'm attaching it to this bug.  This deadlock does not happen all the time but to give you an idea of the frequency, out of 10 launches the deadlock occurred twice. So I'm able to reproduce it relatively quickly and deterministically, which should help to validate the fix."

Tree view: folder icons spinning endlessly  "Abstract : Folder icons may spin endlessly in the tree view if they cannot be fetched because of an I/O error.  Steps to reproduce : - Enable the Tree view on one of the panels - From the panel with the Tree view enabled, change the location to ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg  - When asked for credentials, choose 'Anonymous' user  Expected behavior : - The Tree view is updated with the new location and all its parent folders(tree nodes) are expanded.  Actual behavior : - One of the parent folders(usually /pub) cannot be expanded - the spinning dial icon spins endlessly(see attached screenshot).  Additional information: - The debug output indicates that the folder failed to be listed(exception in FTPFile.ls()) because of the following FTP server error ""530 Sorry, the maximum number of clients(3) from your host are already connected."". This means that 3 concurrent threads were already accessing the FTP server(each with its own connection) when the ls() attempt was made. - The bug can be reproduced most of the time but not always. It shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 attempts to reproduce it. - This was reproduced under Mac OS X 10.5 with Java 1.6 but I don't think this is relevant.  I see two separate issues that would need to be addressed:  1) The folder listing should fail gracefully, whatever the reason of the failure is. The folder icon should probably be changed to one that symbolizes the failure: CustomFileIconProvider.NOT_ACCESSIBLE_FILE might be a good fit.  2) It seems that the tree spawns 4 threads(or more). We should reduce the number of concurrent threads and serialize some of the I/O operations made by the tree to play nice with protocols such as FTP."

When selected, the location field's contents and the same suggestion('test.zip') appears again.  Additional information: - This happens only with archives, folders are fine. - If the archive path ends with a trailing separator(/Users/maxence/test.zip), the behavior is OK: the auto-completion popup suggests folders located inside the archive."

SFTP connection fails when password contains a '/'  "Hello. We use an internal(linux) server for file transfers. I can sftp there by using WinScp and without giving any directory/path option, I arrive to my home folder(/home/project). Unfortunately muCommander enters in any case a ""/"" sign, so I land in the root directory, where I don't have permission to list the content(permission for ""others"": --x). Even if I enter the correct path(where I'm allowed to go through, I just don't have the permission to list the content, until I arrive in my home directory), muCommander don't succed and reports ""URL contains an invalid port"". Most probably as it tries to list the content.  The same problem is present under OSX, so it's not a windows problem, but I don't know how far JAVA runtime libraries are the same. My Windows library is version is 6 Update 11, those of my mac is Java for Mac OSX 10.5 Update 3.  The situation is the same with v0.8.3.  I hope that you can easily find the bug. I enjoy this cross-platform file manager, I hope so much that I don't have to use different browsers for local and sftp folders.  Thank you for your efforts and best regards, Ferenc"

L&F works if I copy the library to ~/.mucommander/export, but the import dialog doesn't work.

Folder panels separator gets messed up on resize  "Steps to reproduce: - Resize the main window to make its width as small as possible. - Increase the main window's width again.  Expected behaviour: - the folder panel's separator should stay in the position it was initially(usually 50% of the main window)  Observed behaviour: - the folder panel's separator gets pushed to the far right of the window  I fixed an issue very similar to that one ages ago which had to do with the way resize events were handled - the position of the separator was calculated at the ""wrong"" time and was sometimes set to 0. Maybe it's another symptom of this issue and I didn't fix it as well as I thought I had. "

Actual behavior:  - Only the File menu appears, Edit menu doesn't.  Additional notes:  - Cmd+Tab to another application and back to muCommander refreshes the menu bar and causes the Edit menu to appear.  - This bug is caused by JMenuBar not refreshing the menu after it has first been displayed.

0.8.3 -> 0.8.4 migration issues  "=== Steps to reproduce ===   * Delete muCommander preferences folder(make a backup copy of it first:)  * Start muCommander 0.8.3 and quit  * Start muCommander 0.8.4(current nightly)  === Issues ===  1) 101 log warnings are displayed on startup(one for each action it seems), here are the first ten: {{{      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.924] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 1 canceling mapping to ShowParentFoldersQL      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.925] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 2 canceling mapping to ShowRecentLocationsQL      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.926] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 3 canceling mapping to ShowRecentExecutedFil$      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.927] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: alt 4 canceling mapping to ShowBookmarksQL      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.927] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control B canceling mapping to AddBookmark      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.927] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control G canceling mapping to ChangeLocation      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.929] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: F10 canceling mapping to CloseWindow      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.929] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,117 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: meta W canceling mapping to CloseWindow      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.929] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control M canceling mapping to CompareFolders      [2009-08-21 16:51:50.930] WARNING ActionKeymapReader#processKeystrokeAttribute,105 action keymap file contains multiple associations for keystroke: control K canceling mapping to ConnectToServer }}}  2) If you quit 0.8.4 and take a look at the `action_keymap.xml`, you'll notice there is one action there(!OpenInOtherPanel), even though no action was ever customized: {{{ <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <!-- See http://trac.mucommander.com/wiki/ActionKeyMap for information on how to customize this file --> <keymap version=""0.8.4"">     <action id=""OpenInOtherPanel"" keystroke=""ctrl ENTER""/> </keymap> }}}  3) If you take a look at `command_bar.xml`(again after quitting 0.8.4), you'll notice actions are still referenced using the action class path and not the action Id : {{{ <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <command_bar modifier=""SHIFT"">     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.ViewAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.EditAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.CopyAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.LocalCopyAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.MoveAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.RenameAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.MkdirAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.MkfileAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.DeleteAction"" alt_action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.PermanentDeleteAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.RefreshAction""/>     <button action=""com.mucommander.ui.action.CloseWindowAction""/> </command_bar> }}}  => I guess the file would have been updated to the new 0.8.4 format if changes were made to the command bar using the command bar editor. I suggest we toggle the 'dirty' flag after the import, so the file is written to the new 0.8.4 format upon application exit.   4) Same for `toolbar.xml`. "

Java version number in About dialog  "The Java version number displayed in the About dialog is using the `java.vm.version` property rather than `java.version`.  While most VMs have a meaningful version number(e.g. 1.5.07b), the latest Apple 1.6 VM has 14.1, which is confusing.  We should either use `java.version` instead of `java.vm.version`, or use both."

Search as you type behaviour changed  "* The space bar does not select files anymore, but muCommander searches for files with a space in the name. * After typing a few letters, the cursor jumps to the correct file, but hitting enter does not open the file / folder until a few seconds have elapsed, and the 'search as you type' mode is switched back off.  Before, space selected files, and I could hit enter right after a search which made it possible to browse the file system very quickly."

Should the free space indicator be flipped around?  "I just came to think about how the free space indicator looks, and I think that it is turned around compared to what's normal.  Normally I would think of the bar being the amount of space used on the drive, since it would then ""fill up"" the bar when you fill up the drive. Is this just me?  Also, it would be cool if the bar gradually changed color, when more space was used on the drive, so it would have an orange color at, say, 90% used, and a red color when it's more than 95% used."

Missing text string for pack_dialog.pack  In the Pack dialog there is a bug which causes the submit button to be named '''pack_dialog.pack'''. This is specified in source:trunk/source/com/mucommander/ui/dialog/file/PackDialog.java@#L153

Single click treated as double click  "If the user clicks on file âAâ in the file table, and then clicks on file âBâ soon enough, the second click will be treated as a double click on file âBâ, which launches / opens âBâ.  Expected: to move the selection bar to file âBâ without opening it.  Similarly, if the â..â item is double clicked, in the parent folder a single click on the â..â item will be treated as a double click and will take the user to the parent folder. This leads to unwanted folder changes.  Consider: two double clicks on â..â should take the user up two levels. Instead, it takes them up three levels."

"""Round displayed file sizes"" does sometimes not toggle correctly"  "Toggling the ""'''Round displayed file sizes'''"" checkbox in the ""'''Folder'''"" section of the preferences does sometimes not behave correctly, that is, even if the checkbox is marked, the file sizes are not displayed as rounded values and vice versa. Sometimes it works correctly, sometimes not. Just play around toggling the checkbox and watch the folder view. The behaviour is reproducable!"
